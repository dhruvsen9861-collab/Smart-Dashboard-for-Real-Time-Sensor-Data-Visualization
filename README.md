# Smart-Dashboard-for-Real-Time-Sensor-Data-Visualization
Developed a Smart Dashboard for real-time sensor data visualization using Power BI. Integrated Python scripts to collect, store, and push sensor data (temperature, humidity, motion, air quality) with alerts for threshold breaches, enabling efficient monitoring and data-driven insights.
