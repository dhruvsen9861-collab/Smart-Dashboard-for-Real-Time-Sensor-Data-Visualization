*DESCRIPTION*: This project involves creating a Smart Dashboard for real-time monitoring of sensor data, including temperature, humidity, motion, air quality, and noise level. Python scripts collect data, push it to Power BI for visualization, and store historical records in CSV files for trend analysis. The dashboard features interactive visuals and an automated alert system that sends email notifications to users when sensor readings exceed thresholds. This project demonstrates the integration of IoT, Python, and business intelligence tools, providing practical, data-driven insights for applications like smart homes, industries, and environmental monitoring.
